## Hardware Requirements for CAPI Implementation

Remember that the hardware requirements will be the same regardless of which software package you choose for your project. So let's take a look at some slides for the specifics.

* First of all, you need a personal computer or laptop to set up your survey; tablets; power banks and a pocket or portable Wi-Fi.

For the tablet specifications, you see that Survey Solutions and CSPro generally has the same requirements, except for Survey Solutions â€“ it requires an android version 5.1. Both requires a minimum of 1.5 gigabytes of RAM; a memory of at least 1 gigabyte; a Wi-Fi or 3G or 4G connectivity; and the screen size would depend on the requirements of the survey.So here are some useful tablet tips. So the more complicated the survey, the higher the specs required. Depending on the extent of of your survey, it is usually more practical to purchase a high-end tablet at the onset. Also remember to get extra tablets for backup
as tablets can break our get loss during field work. Also, field supervisors require tablet too. Make sure to purchase cases as this will increase the lifespan of your tablets. Android mobile phones can also be used, but tablets are recommended.

## Connectivity tips

### Now here are some connectivity tips.

CAPI is best used with Internet connectivity. Once cases are synchronized over the Internet to the server, the data is safe.

A SIM card for each tablet with good 3G or 4G coverage should be ideal, or you could have one SIM card per team and share using a wireless hotspot. If there is no mobile coverage, you can also use Wi-Fi when possible. 

For power solutions, remember since tablet batteries can run low during long days of interviewing, it is practical to bring power banks to charge tablets during field work. The higher the mAh capacity, the more charges they can last. Car chargers or solar chargers are also an alternative option. You might also want to train your interviewers to turn off Wi-Fi and screen brightness down during interviewing to conserve batteries.

### Headquaters

For the headquarters, you will need laptop or desktop PCs running on Windows for your staff to use. You also need a cloud server to store data on either Dropbox or repository on github or gitlab or a physical server at your headquarters. Check out the specifications required at the CSPro or github websites.
That's all for the hardware requirements.
