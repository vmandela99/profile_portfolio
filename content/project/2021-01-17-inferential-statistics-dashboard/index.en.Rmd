If you have developed and deployed a Shiny app and would like to embed it in blogdown, follow these steps:

1. create a new post as usual
1. add `runtime: shiny` (and `output: html_document` if it is not already included) in the YAML metadata
1. insert the following HTML code in the body of the post:

```
<iframe height="800" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://josabusmart.shinyapps.io/InferentialStatistics/"> </iframe>
```

You should change the URL with the URL of your deployed Shiny app (after `src=`, do not forget that the URL should start with `http://` or `https://` and should be surrounded by `"`). Moreover, you can modify the height, the width and include or not a frame border with the corresponding tags.

Here is an example of the result with one of my Shiny app ([link](https://josabusmart.shinyapps.io/InferentialStatistics/) to the app):

<iframe height="800" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://josabusmart.shinyapps.io/InferentialStatistics/"> </iframe>

<br>

*Note that the app may not work if it has hit the monthly usage limit. Try again later if that is the case.*


If you encounter an issue, try loading the following packages in the body of your new post: `shiny`, `widgetframe` (you can load a package with the command `library(widgetframe)`). If one of the package is not installed yet, you can do it with the command `install.packages("widgetframe")`.

I hope this article helped you to embed a Shiny app in your website.
